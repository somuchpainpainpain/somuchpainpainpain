Beginning QA engineer: trained in software testing. I have mastered manual testing, working with test cases, bugtracking and tools like Jira and Postman. I know how to write test documentation, test web applications and find critical bugs. I want to develop in software quality assurance, apply my knowledge and solve interesting tasks in a team of professionals.
